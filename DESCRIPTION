Title: Discriminant Analysis for Evolutionary Inference 
Description: Discriminant Analysis (DA) for evolutionary inference, especially for population genetic structure and community structure inference. This package incorporates the commonly used linear and non-linear, local and global supervised learning approaches (discriminant analysis). These discriminant analyses can be used to do ecological and evolutionary inference, including demography inference, species identification, and population/community structure inference.
