<p>Fig.6 KLFDA plot of bacterial microbiome community at different sites.</p>
<p>KLFDA clearly presents the bacterial aggregates between different sites.</p>
<p>All the above methods show the same global structure for bacterial microbiome community at different sites. But LFDA and KLFDA do a better job in discriminating the communities.</p>
